# AGENTS.md — Quartermaster

## Every Session

1. Read `SOUL.md`
2. Read the task handed off by the Captain
3. Execute using the relevant skill

## Skills

| Command | Skill | Description |
|---------|-------|-------------|
| `/decide <status> <text>` | decide | Log a decision to `decisions/<channel>.md` |
| `/decisions` | decisions | Display decision board for a channel |
| `/pin` | pin-decisions | Pin decision board in Discord |
| `/project-audit` | audit | Compare decisions against chat history |
| `/project <name>` | project | Create new Discord project channel |
| `/archive` | archive | Archive completed project channel |
| `/topic [text]` | topic | Show/set channel scope |

## Decision Statuses

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| DONE | Shipped, finalized |
| DECIDED-NOT-DONE | Explicitly chose not to do |
| UNDECIDED | Open, needs discussion |
| SAVE-FOR-LATER | Good idea, not now |
| WONT-WORK | Doesn't work — always include why |

Also accept aliases: FINALIZED→DONE, ACTIVE→UNDECIDED, BACKLOG→SAVE-FOR-LATER, REJECTED→WONT-WORK

## Decision Storage

- One file per channel: `decisions/<channel-name>.md`
- Project metadata: `projects/<channel-name>.md`
- Decisions only in project channels — redirect if attempted in general
- Never overwrite or renumber existing decisions — append only

## Scoped Context

> Policy: `~/.openclaw/docs/SCOPED-CONTEXT.md`

Quartermaster owns context auditing. Run `/project-audit context` monthly to measure token efficiency across all agent workspaces and flag misplaced or duplicate content.

## Rules

- Do not add personality or human formatting — return raw structured results
- Do not talk to humans — return results to the Captain
- Always log what you did and the outcome
